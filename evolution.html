        THE EVOLUTION OF EQUALITY OF GENDER

      <p id="article">
        During the eighteenth century and especially during the French Revolution,
        the goal of women was to live legally to live
        independent and free. They have been able to embody values ​​of freedom, equality
        and fraternity.
        Women revolt, petition, claim their political, civil and professional equality. They ask for girls and young
        people
        women a similar education to that given to boys, an equal
        access to higher education and equal opportunities through training.
        They require solutions to reduce the mortality in layers .

        Can not reduce feminism to a simple definition, but to a set of unique, political and social ideas
        Some axes of claiming feminism have remained the same since the 1970s
        While women are now supposed to be equal to men, does feminism still have its place? Debate of society, some cry
        that with the equality of the sexes, the feminism is dead, that it does not have any more to be.

      <p id="article">
        What has happened since the early 1990s, when feminism was exhausted and out of season, is the emergence of new
        forms of feminism. They force us to rethink feminisms as much as the social movements and to draw the weaknesses
        but also the new horizons in the national and international space.

      <p id="article">
        History has given, preferably, a political meaning to "feminism". This sense was imposed by the double reference
        to Fourier and Dumas fils, starting from two theoretical and political currents of the nineteenth century,
        utopian, socialist and Marxist thought, and republican and democratic thought.
