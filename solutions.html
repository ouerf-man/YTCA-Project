            <h4> Talk to women and girls</h4>
            <p>A fundamental reason we have not yet achieved gender equality in every realm is that women and girls’
                voices are too often excluded from global and national decision-making. When programmes and policies
                are designed without women’s needs central to their foundation, we’re setting ourselves up to fail.
                If grassroots women had been adequately consulted in designing the MDGs, decision-makers would have
                been able to anticipate that girls would still be held responsible for many home chores, caring for
                younger siblings and fetching water, and have known that a major obstacle for girls’ education is
                that girls are at risk of physical and sexual assaults when they have to walk long distances to
                school. </p>

            <h4> Make education gender sensitive</h4>
            <p>There has been much progress in increasing access to education, but progress has been slow in improving
                the gender sensitivity of the education system, including ensuring textbooks promote positive
                stereotypes. This is critically important for girls to come out of schools as citizens who can shape a
                more equal society. In some countries, there is a tendency to assume that things are fine as long as
                there are equal number of girls in schools. Aya Kibesaki, senior education specialist, Global
                Partnership for Education, Washington DC, USA </p>

            <h4> Give proper value to ‘women’s work</h4>
            <p>The unpaid work women and girls do provide the foundation for the global economy. This fact needs to be
                highlighted more in the media, with the private sector and in communities. More research and data for
                messaging on this point could be useful in promoting the key role and contributions women and girls make
                to the economy and the need for proper recognition and compensation. We also need a concerted campaign
                for equal pay for equal work worldwide. Legislation, economic incentives, and pledges like the UN’s
                Women’s Empowerment Principles should be adapted and replicated everywhere. Patricia T. Morris</p>
